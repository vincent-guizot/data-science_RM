# 🧠 Data Science Roadmap

A 12-week journey to become a capable data scientist, from fundamentals to portfolio-ready projects.

---

## 📅 Week 1–2: Python & Data Foundations
- Learn Python syntax and best practices
- Explore:
  - Data types, control structures
  - Functions, OOP basics
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`
- Resources:
  - [Python for Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
  - [Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)

---

## 📅 Week 3: Data Cleaning & Manipulation
- Work with missing values, duplicates, outliers
- Use `pandas` for wrangling
- Techniques:
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Handling time series data
- Project: Clean a messy dataset from Kaggle

---

## 📅 Week 4: Data Visualization
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- Visualize:
  - Distributions, correlations
  - Time series, category comparisons
- Build a mini dashboard (optional)

---

## 📅 Week 5–6: Statistics & Probability
- Descriptive & inferential stats
- Probability distributions
- Hypothesis testing, p-values
- Linear regression basics
- Resources:
  - [StatQuest YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer)
  - [Khan Academy Stats](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)

---

## 📅 Week 7–8: Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning:
  - Regression, Classification
- Algorithms: `Linear Regression`, `Logistic Regression`, `Decision Trees`, `Random Forest`
- Evaluate with `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `F1`, `ROC AUC`
- Tools: `scikit-learn`

---

## 📅 Week 9: Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering (`k-means`, `hierarchical`)
- Dimensionality Reduction (`PCA`, `t-SNE`)
- Apply to real-world data (e.g., customer segmentation)

---

## 📅 Week 10: SQL & Databases
- Learn SQL: `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, subqueries
- Tools: SQLite, PostgreSQL
- Use with Python (`sqlalchemy`, `pandas.read_sql()`)

---

## 📅 Week 11: Real-World Projects
- End-to-end ML pipeline
- Include:
  - Data sourcing & cleaning
  - Model training & evaluation
  - Visualization & insights
- Ideas:
  - Predict housing prices
  - Classify tweets
  - Customer churn prediction

---

## 📅 Week 12: Portfolio, Git, and Deployment
- Build your GitHub portfolio:
  - Jupyter notebooks with markdown explanations
  - Clear README files
- Deploy a model with:
  - Flask + Heroku or FastAPI
- Write a blog post explaining your project (e.g., on Medium or Hashnode)

---

## 🔁 Ongoing
- 📊 Compete on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
- 🎓 Learn deep learning: `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`
- 📚 Read papers: [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/)
